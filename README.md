# code-vein-macro

Overview
This script allows you run a macro with will be used to farm the item 'Mark of Honor' in Code Vein. This is mostly used to get the achievement called 'Exalted Reputation' which takes a very long time to do. This macro will allow you to save very many hours of grinding online or offline, there are conditions that have to be met to start this process. These are listed in the prerequisites section.

Prerequisites
Ideally you are a decent level in order to 1-shot an enemy in the Tower of Trials I, see other resources on how to access this level in the depths. If you are not yet at the level where you can 1-shot this particular enemy with the buffs I'll be listing. This is a similar setup that Electric Husky on youtube uses, take a look for the exact order and weapon but I'll list them here in case the video is ever taken down.

Weapon: Argent Wolf King's Blade Fortification +10
Blood Veil: Night Claw Fortification +10 (Or highest Damaging Blood Veil)
Blood Code: Prometheus

Passive Gifts: 
1. Strength/Dexterity Up
2. Vow of Ichor
3. Revenant's Greed
4. Two Handed Sword Mastery

Top Set
Top: Adrenaline

Bottom: Flashing Fang

Bottom Set

Bottom: Merciless Reaper

Active Shortcut (Active Item Set when you press down arrow)
1. Mistle Root

Installation
1. Download Pulover's Macro Creator (Mind the installation process so you don't install the browser add-on)
2. Once installed, import the .pmc file located in this github repository
3. Run Code Vein and teleport to the Tower of Trials I
4. Run the Script

Expected Result
The player character will begin running back to use the 'Proceed to Lower Level'. Then will run left to position themselves closer to the hole and will begin to buff with the active gifts in a specific order. Then will drop down into the hole, run up to the enemy, charge a heavy attack and kill the enemy in one shot, this enemy awards a 'Mark of Honor' item every so often. Then the player will use the mistle root item and teleport back to the mistle and then repeat the process all over again. You can leave this script running overnight or however long you need and it will farm these mark's of honor for you.
